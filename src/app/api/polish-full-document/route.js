      `Rules:\n` +
      `1. Do NOT delete, omit, or summarize any content from the provided answers.\n` +
      `2. Only combine, organize, and polish the answers, ensuring every grant requirement is addressed.\n` +
      `3. The output should be as detailed as possible, preserving all information.\n` +
      `4. If you find any section that is missing information, unclear, or requires a plan/strategy, STOP and return a list of specific clarification questions for the user to answer.\n` +
      `5. Do NOT invent or assume any information that is not present in the answers or clarifications.\n` +
      `6. If clarifications are provided, incorporate them in the appropriate sections.\n` +
      `7. The final output should be a single, ready-to-submit document, formatted in HTML (no markdown).\n` +
      `8. When asking clarification questions, ONLY ask for missing factual information. Do NOT reference section-specific jargon, grant section names, or assume the user knows what the grant is asking. Phrase each question in plain, user-friendly language, and be specific about what factual detail is missing.\n` +
      `9. Do NOT ask the user to "clarify" or "elaborate" in general termsâ€”be concrete about what information is needed.\n` +
      `10. Minimize the number of clarification questions. Only ask for information that is absolutely required to complete the draft. Do NOT ask broad, open-ended, or fluffy questions. Each question must be specific, actionable, and only about factual gaps that prevent completion.\n` +
      `11. Ask at most 3 clarification questions per round. If more information is still needed after the user answers, you may ask follow-up questions in the next round.\n` +
      `12. When determining what to ask, carefully reference the original grant guidelines, questions, the draft answers, and all known information about the organization. Only ask for information that is truly missing after considering all available context.\n` +
