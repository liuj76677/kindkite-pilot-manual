# AI Grant Writing Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to build an AI-powered grant writing workflow for KindKite, supporting comprehensive draft generation, PDF export, and human-AI collaboration.

---

## **Milestone 1: Centralize and Fetch Organization Data**
- [ ] Build a backend API endpoint to fetch all relevant data for an organization (e.g., Tembo Education) from MongoDB.
- [ ] Ensure the frontend can request and receive this data for use in AI prompts.

## **Milestone 2: AI-Driven Draft Generation**
- [ ] Update the draft response UI to allow the user to trigger AI draft generation for all grant questions.
- [ ] Send both the grant questions and the full org data to the AI model.
- [ ] Display the AI-generated answers in the draft response interface.
- [ ] Allow users to re-generate or refine answers with additional prompts.

## **Milestone 3: Full Application View & Highlighting**
- [ ] Provide a full, scrollable view of the entire draft application (all questions/sections).
- [ ] Implement highlighting so users (or the AI) can flag sections needing human review or additional input.
- [ ] Visually indicate which sections are AI-complete and which need attention.

## **Milestone 4: PDF Export of Application**
- [ ] Add a "Download PDF" button to the draft response interface.
- [ ] Use a PDF generation library (e.g., jsPDF, pdf-lib, or server-side) to export the full application in the required format (e.g., D-Prize concept note, other grant-specific templates).
- [ ] Ensure formatting matches the grant's requirements (page limits, section order, etc.).

## **Milestone 5: Grant-Specific Requirements & Templates**
- [ ] For each grant, define the required structure (e.g., D-Prize two-page concept note, Roddenberry narrative, etc.).
- [ ] Map AI-generated answers to the correct sections in the PDF and UI.

## **Milestone 6: Human-AI Collaboration Features**
- [ ] Allow users to edit, accept, or further prompt the AI for improvements on any section.
- [ ] Track which sections have been reviewed/edited by a human.
- [ ] Optionally, allow users to add comments or notes for team collaboration.

---

## **Stretch Goals**
- [ ] Support for multiple organizations (org-specific dashboards).
- [ ] Version history and change tracking for drafts.
- [ ] Real-time collaborative editing.
